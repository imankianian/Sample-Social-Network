# Sample-Social-Network
1. The main screen displays a list of posts with their likes and comments counts. You can like or unlike a post.
2. By clicking on a post, you can visit the post with its comments. On this page you can like or unlike a post, read comments and add your own comment.
3. The main screen and the post details screen are implemented using a simple paging approach. I haven't using Android paging library. Rather I have implemented a simple one.

This project is using the following stack:
- Kotlin + Coroutines + Flows
- Jetpack navigation + SafeArgs + RecyclerView
- MVVM + Single Activity + Repository
- Room + Coil + Hilt
- Clean Architecture
